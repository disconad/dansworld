Name: Clara Ironheart

Description: Clara Ironheart is a stout and formidable dwarf with a no-nonsense demeanor and a steely gaze that brooks no dissent. Her graying hair is tied back in a tight braid, and her sturdy frame speaks of years spent toiling in the fields and storerooms of Stonehaven.

Basic Background: Clara serves as the overseer of the colony's food stores, responsible for managing the distribution of provisions to the residents of Stonehaven. However, unbeknownst to her fellow dwarves, she has been secretly hoarding supplies for herself in anticipation of lean times ahead.

Personal Ideal: Clara's personal ideal is one of self-preservation and security. She believes in taking whatever measures necessary to ensure her own survival, even if it means depriving others of essential resources.

Character Flaw: Clara's paranoia and mistrust of others lead her to hoard food and supplies, even when there is no immediate threat of scarcity. Her actions sow discord and resentment among the populace, eroding the sense of unity and cooperation that is crucial for the colony's survival.
