# Ogre Raid

level 5-7

## Ogre Raid Preparations:

The ogres, driven by hunger, gather their forces as dusk approaches. Despite their weakened state, their sheer numbers and brute strength make them a formidable threat.
They organize themselves into a rough formation and prepare crude weapons such as clubs, axes, and makeshift spears, lacking the finesse of proper military equipment.

## Raid Commencement:

As darkness descends upon Stonehaven, the ogres launch their raid with a primal roar, charging towards the colony with reckless abandon.
The defenders, already on edge due to their own hunger and lack of resources, scramble to respond to the sudden attack.

## Brute Force Assault:

The ogres attempt to smash through the sturdy stone walls of Stonehaven using their sheer strength, battering at the gates and walls with their crude weapons.
The defenders, though hungry and ill-equipped, rally to defend their home, using whatever weapons and tactics they can muster to repel the ogres' onslaught.

## Defenders' Resistance:

Despite their weakened state, the defenders of Stonehaven fight valiantly, using their knowledge of the terrain and the layout of the mine to their advantage.
They set up barricades and traps within the mine to slow the ogres' advance, buying precious time for reinforcements to arrive or for a potential escape plan to be enacted.

## Desperate Struggle:

As the battle rages on, both sides suffer heavy casualties. The defenders, fueled by desperation and determination, refuse to yield to the ogres' relentless assault.
The ogres, weakened by hunger and fatigue, begin to falter in their attack, their brute force tactics proving less effective against the well-fortified defenses of Stonehaven.


## Aftermath:

The raid leaves both sides reeling, with the ogres forced to seek sustenance elsewhere and the defenders of Stonehaven left to pick up the pieces of their shattered home.
The raid serves as a sobering reminder of the harsh realities of survival in a world plagued by hunger and desperation, as both sides grapple with the consequences of their actions.
