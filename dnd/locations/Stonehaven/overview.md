## Approach

The mountain pass leading to Stonehaven proper is a winding series of switchbacks carved into rugged terrain. On this wet and overcast day, scattered showers add to the challenge of the journey, making the rocky path slick and treacherous. Despite the inclement weather, travelers can often find respite at each switchback. Flat areas provide opportunities to rest, catch their breath, and opportunites to mingle with other travelling groups.

Amidst the gloomy backdrop of the mountain pass, the band and a group of travellers witness a tense confrontation over a coinpurse. As accusations fly and tempers flare, the air humming with hostility the band breaks into an impromptu perforfance. This serves as a brief distraction, momentarily diffusing the tension as the focus shift to the Croaks. As they play, they witness the conflict reach its end, the holder of the purse shanking his comrade and rocketing down the mountain pass.

## Arrival

Stonehaven proper, nestled atop the mountain pass, a bustling mining settlement characterized by sturdy stone buildings and bustling streets.

Today however, the bustling streets of Stonehaven are quieter than usual, as the village grapples with a looming food shortage.


## Quest hooks:

Twenty years ago, the dwarves started a mining operation in Stonehaven, on the outer reaches of their domain. A few years later, the tailings dam accidentally ruptured, filling the mine with water and mud and causing collapses that trapped those who survived the flooding. The remaining colonists eventually ran out of air, dying a slow death in the darkness of the mine's depths. This tragic mass death spawned an overshadow (see Area 9), a terrible undead abomination formed of the fearful, hopeless souls who perished in the accident. The creature has dwelled in the dark, flooded, and collapsed mine ever since.

Recently the dwarven leaders decided it was time to reopen the mines in Stonehaven, and they sent a new group of colonists to excavate and reopen the mine. The colonists repaired the dam, then built and refurbished equipment to pump the water out of the mine and back into the holding pond. Afterwards, they toiled to excavate the rooms of sediment and collapsed stone. Eventually, they opened the chamber where the overshadow waited. It was hungry but eager to make its new prey last. It took them slowly at first, building their fear and panic before finishing off the remaining survivors. Now Stonehaven Mine has once again gone silent. Messengers to the outpost have failed to return, and the dwarven rulers urgently desire answers.

Adventure Hooks
The following hooks can be used to draw the PCs into investigating Thyrdun Outpost.

- The dwarven leaders that rule the land on which Thyrdun Outpost stands hire the PCs to investigate, discover the reason for the outpost's silence, and offer any aid they can to the colonists.
- While traveling, inclement weather causes the PCs to seek shelter. They discover the outpost, only to find it abandoned, and decide to investigate further, whether out of concern or motivated by possible profit.
- A friend of the PCs is overdue to meet or contact them (perhaps a traveling merchant, bard, or other similar NPC). The friend's last known location was the small mining outpost of Thyrdun, and the PCs head there. The status of the NPC is for the GM to determine; this person could be yet another victim of the overshadow, alive but hiding somewhere in the outpost, or perhaps not even there, having moved on or never even arrived.
