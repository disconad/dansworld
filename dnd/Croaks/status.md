# Quests
### Play the gig - *completed* - 200 xp (50 each) - 8 gp
- The croaks played their gig at Willowbrook
### Where is our shit? - *completed* - 200 xp (50 each) - 15 gp + gear
- Two thieves, Blake and Jerry(?), had taken the bands gear. They followed and got it back. Left them naked and in a lovers pose.
### Track down the stolen cattle - *completed* 
- The Miltons are missing some fine breeding cattle, and these are prime specimen, quite valuable. Help them find out what happened. Billy Milton promised you gold.
- Upon finding the missing cattle, two of which were apparently castrated, the band stumbles across a dark ritual. Fey, darklings to be precise, were sucking the life from a massive Goliath. <enter Krodaak>  Battle ensued, bringing low Oneleg and Beau. Luckily the band was able to rally with their newfound friend, and recover, only to be beset again by a swarm of the dark creatures. - 
- Flee. The group takes flight, hauling the cattle along back to the farm as the darklings give chase. One is able to sink it's dagger into Tam Tam, the others close at his heels.
- Recovery. The band escapes, killing many of the darklings and returning the cattle. Farmer Milton is delighted, paying them in lunch, lemonade, and little coin.
### Play the gig, night two - *completed* - 500 xp (100 each) - 12 gp (Walter)
- The Croaks finished another night at Willowbrook, this time regailing the crowd with bagpipes and guitar solos. Finishing with the classics. A patron tries to `seduce` Tam Tam with a spiked drink, Beau downs it with no ill effect, but the fellow really is enamored with the percussionist. 
### Things go wrong... - *completed* - 200 xp (40 each)
- Blake and Jerry are back, and poisoned the performers' food. No one was affected. They crept out into the back and accosted Walter, who gave em the slip and alerted the band. The band retaliates by beating Jerry unconscious, chasing Blake down and feed him a mouthful of poison spray. Oneleg then executes Jerry. Krodaak stuffs the bodies into two empty barrels after a gentle folding. 
- Finishing their set, the band then hoists the barrels out to the nearest lake. It's late, and they aren't seen leaving, or wandering up to the shores of Kalarny Lake, an old limestone mining quarry. No one really swims there due to the basic nature of the water, but the fishing is good, and it is quite deep. Collectively they efficiently and effectively pack the barrels with stone, sand, and clay, filling all potential gaps. Now, with two 400 lb + barrels, Krodaak is able to toss them ~ 20 feet out where they anchor to the depths. 
- Back to the bar, a patron continues to try and seduce Tam Tam. One leg gets drunk, using his flute/blowgun as a straw. He accidentally fires at a commoner, severely wounding him and destroying his eye. Luckily, along with the help of Tam Tam and Beau, the wound is healed and the man survives. E(dwins?) Lament indeed.
