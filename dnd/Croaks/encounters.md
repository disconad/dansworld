# Random Encounter: Goblin Ambush

As your party continues on the road towards the next town, you come across a scene of chaos. A family, huddled near their overturned wagon, is under attack by a group of goblins. The goblins are armed with crude weapons and seem intent on stealing the family's possessions.

### Description:

The family consists of a father, a mother, and two young children. They look terrified and have taken cover behind the wagon.

There are nearly a dozen (ten) goblins, shouting and brandishing rusty weapons as they harass the family.
The goblins have already managed to steal some of the family's belongings, scattering them across the road.

### Options for the Party:

**Engage in Combat**: The party can choose to confront the goblins in combat to rescue the family and retrieve their stolen possessions.

**Negotiation and Diplomacy**: If the party prefers a non-violent approach, they can attempt to negotiate with the goblins, offering something in exchange for the family's safety or persuading the goblins to leave peacefully.

**Ambush and Stealth**: For a more covert approach, the party might choose to set up an ambush to surprise the goblins and gain the upper hand.
### Consequences:

If the party successfully defeats the goblins, they earn the gratitude of the rescued family. The family might offer a reward or provide information about the region.

If the party chooses diplomacy, the outcome depends on their negotiation skills. A successful negotiation might convince the goblins to leave, while a failed one could lead to combat.

Stealthily ambushing the goblins might catch them off guard, but failure could lead to a chaotic battle.


# Continuation: Tracking the Goblins to Their Camp

If the party decides to follow the goblins after their encounter on the road, they find a hidden path, DC 12 survival, leading to the goblin camp deep in the woods. The camp appears to be well-organized, with crude tents and makeshift barricades. The goblins have taken the stolen belongings from the family here.

### Goblin Camp Encounter: Confronting the Goblin Boss

As the party surveys the camp, they spot a goblin that stands out from the rest. This goblin is larger and more imposing, wielding a jagged, iron-shod club. It's the goblin boss, a ruthless leader who oversees the goblin gang.

The goblin boss fights dirty, using its intimidating presence to strike fear into party members.
It might have goblin underlings who fight alongside it, providing support and creating distractions.
### Options for the Party:

**Stealthy Approach**: The party can attempt to sneak into the camp, sabotage the goblin boss's authority, or steal back the family's belongings.

**Direct Confrontation**: If the party chooses to engage the goblin boss in combat, they can challenge its leadership and put an end to the goblin threat.

**Negotiation and Diplomacy**: For a diplomatic approach, the party might try to persuade the goblin boss to release the stolen items and leave the area.

### Consequences:

Defeating the goblin boss and his gang secures the family's belongings and eliminates the goblin threat in the area.

Successful stealth and sabotage could weaken the goblin boss's authority, possibly leading to the goblins dispersing or accepting the party's terms.

Diplomatic success might result in the goblin boss agreeing to leave the area peacefully, but failure could lead to combat.

# Random Encounter: The Mysterious Fog

As your party continues their journey along the road between Willowbrook and Silverglade, they encounter an unusual and eerie phenomenon. A dense, unnatural fog begins to roll in, enveloping the road and obscuring their vision.

**Seek Shelter**: They can choose to look for a nearby structure or terrain feature to take shelter from the fog until it dissipates.

**Investigate the Symbols**: If the party examines the symbols, they might uncover clues about the fog's origin and nature.

### Consequences:

Seeking shelter may delay their journey, but they could discover valuable information or meet interesting NPCs in the shelter they find.

Investigating the symbols may uncover the fog's source, enabling the party to dispel it or use it for their advantage, depending on its nature.

### Glimpses of Shadowy Figures:
