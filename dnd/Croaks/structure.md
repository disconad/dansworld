## Town structures

**1. Village Classification:**
- Determine the size and importance of each village. Are they simple hamlets, thriving market towns, or something in between?
- Decide on the village's main focus (e.g., farming, mining, trade, magic, etc.). This will influence its layout and buildings.

**2. Core Components:**
Design the core components of each village:
- **Central Hub**: A central area with key establishments like an inn, a marketplace, and a town hall.
- **Residential Area**: Where the villagers live. Consider different types of homes, from simple cottages to grand houses.
- **Workshops and Businesses**: Tailor these to the village's focus. For example, a farming village might have a mill, while a mining village would have a smithy.
- **Places of Interest**: Include unique locations such as a temple, library, or magical enclave.

**3. Village Layout:**
- Sketch a basic map of the village. Divide it into sections based on the core components.
- Connect pathways, streets, and alleys to facilitate movement between areas.

**4. Reputation System:**
- Set the baseline reputation as 0 (unknown) for each village.
- Determine what actions affect reputation positively and negatively. For example, helping the villagers might increase reputation, while stealing or causing trouble could decrease it.
- Create a list of reputation ranges (e.g., -10 to -6, -5 to -1, etc.) and define the behaviors associated with each range.

**5. Interaction and Tracking:**
- Track the party's actions that influence the village's reputation.
- Whenever the party completes tasks or makes choices, adjust the village's reputation accordingly.
- Use NPCs to provide feedback on the party's reputation and how they are perceived in the village.

**6. Consequences:**
- Design consequences based on reputation. For instance, a positive reputation might lead to discounts, assistance, and useful information from villagers, while a negative reputation could result in hostility, high prices, and even being shunned.

**7. Evolving Villages:**
- Allow villages to change over time based on the party's actions and the reputation system.
- Reputation improvements could lead to better infrastructure, increased population, and new opportunities.
- Negative reputation changes might result in economic decline, migration, and decreased services.

**8. Story Integration:**
- Weave the village structure and reputation system into your campaign's overarching narrative. Linking them to larger plot points can make the world feel interconnected.

**9. Flexibility:**
- While planning, remain flexible to accommodate unexpected player choices. Adapt the reputation system and village structure based on their actions and decisions.

Remember, the goal is to enhance immersion and player engagement. By creating unique village structures and a reputation system that reacts to the party's choices, you'll provide your players with a richer and more interactive DND experience.
